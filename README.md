This is a calculator web app for the final project in the Foundations section of The Odin Project. This will be a basic calculator 
with a UI complete with basic math functions such as adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing. It will also be able to round 
long decimals and have a "clear" button function as well to reset the UI back to the number 0.
